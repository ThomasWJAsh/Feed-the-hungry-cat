<h2>Christophe the cat is hungry! Knock the turkey drumsticks into his mouth to keep him happy this Christmas.</h2>

<p class = "message">Or, if you'd like to help feed some hungry mogs real turkey dinners, please check out <a href="https://www.bristolarc.org.uk/get-involved/donate/">Bristol Animal Rescue Centre.</a></p>
<p class = "message">We adopted Christophe from Bristol ARC in 2019 and since then I've always made a donation to them and an e-card in place of physical Christmas cards. This year I decided it would be fun to make a game instead!</p>
<p class = "message">Christophe says thank you in advance for your support:</p>
